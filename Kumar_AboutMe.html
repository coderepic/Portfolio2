  <strong>Hello!</strong>
  <p>Hello! My name is Archit Kumar. I am an artist, an inventor, and a seasoned video game developer. I am currently a junior at Dublin High School, and I plan to pursue a career in software development.</p>

  <strong>My Mission</strong>
  <p>In a time of major global challenges such as overpopulation and climate change, our world demands efficiency more than ever. Thankfully, innovative technologies have emerged to streamline all aspects of human life, from communication to transportation to food and energy. As a software developer, I plan to create tools to modernize society in order to meet the demands of our struggling planet.</p>

  <strong>My Journey</strong>
  <p>I began my journey in software when I first got my hands on the Scratch programming tool at 7 years old. Video game development seemed like a natural area for me to merge my artistic and technological skills. Throughout the years, I have remained committed to experimenting with various game development tools, such as the Unity game engine. My experience in game development has both strengthened my software development skills and has given me a unique outlet to solve global challenges.</p>

  <strong>Professional and Volunteer Experience</strong>
  <p>Earlier this year, I decided to put my game development skills to good use and collaborated with the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a non-profit organization that intends to reduce animal cruelty in society. With the PETA staff, I developed a web browser game to denounce a national health laboratory that performed cruel experiments on live monkeys, urging them to utilize more humane experimentation instead. When the game launches in late September 2020, I hope it delivers a profound message to laboratories around the world. </p>

  <p>In addition to my volunteer experience, I worked for 2 years as a tutor at the Russian School of Mathematics. Though not directly related to technology, this experience strengthened my problem-solving and collaboration skills, helping me develop the patience and creativity needed to create video game and software projects.</p>
  
  <strong>Personal Projects and Experiments</strong>
  <p>Along with professional and volunteer work, I understand the value of creative and artistic experimentation. Earlier this year, I launched my own website called Toon Landing: a site dedicated to all of my personal artwork, experiments, and video game projects. Much of my work is humorous and allows me to express my wide array of interests, including history, politics, cartooning, science, and pop culture.</p>
  <p>Feel free to visit my website at: <a href="http://toonlanding.com" target="_blank">www.toonlanding.com</a></p>

  <strong>The Future</strong>
  <p>I am very excited about what opportunities I may find for my development skills in the future. As I continue to improve as a game developer, I plan to expand my knowledge of engineering careers through internships, projects, and research.</p>
  <p>Please feel free to contact me for any questions or queries!</p>
