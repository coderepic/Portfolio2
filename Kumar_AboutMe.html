  <h4>Hello!</h4>
  <p>Hello! My name is Archit Kumar. I am currently a sophomore in Dublin High School. I am passionate about both art and technology, and I plan to develop both of these skills by pursuing a career as a computer scientist. Since I was young, I've loved to use my imagination. Some of my favorie hobbies include drawing, telling jokes, and, of course, designing my own websites and video games. I have a lot of experience in video game development tools such as Scratch, as well as web design tools such as Weebly and Squarespace. I bring a creative and playful twist to all the work that I do, which makes my work stand out as unique and exciting.</p>

  <p>Technology and arts are bringing the world together, and it is my role to be a part of this change by becoming a computer scientist. I plan to work to develop skills in communication and arithmetic - ones that will take me far in this field. </p>

  <p>My current role as a substitute tutor at the Russian School of Mathematics has taught me fundamental work skills - teaching, speaking, and problem solving. I have reinforced these skills through other public activities, including my volunteer service at the Dublin Library. </p>

  <p>My work ethic is further demonstrated through my rigourous class and course schedule. I am currently studying Computer Science Principles to strengthen my knowledge of computers and to prepare myself for a career in computer science. I am also challenging myself with many advanced courses such as AP European History and Advanced English. I use these courses as opportunities to sharpen my writing and to build a critical, detail-oriented outlook on my work.</p>
  </p>

  <p>Overall, my creativity, work experience, social skills, projects and work ethic have all prepared me for the challenging and rewarding career of a computer scientist.</p>
