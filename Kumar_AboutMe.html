  <p>Hello! My name is Archit Kumar. I am currently a junior in Dublin High School, and an aspiring software and video game designer. </p>

  <p>Throughout recent years, video games have emerged not only as a form of entertainment, but as an invaluable tool to numerous professionals, including doctors, city planners, vehicle designers, and architects. As a game designer, I plan to use my artistic and technological skills to create tools to aid in all aspects of societal growth and innovation.</p>

  <p>My career in video game design began when I was seven years old, when I first got my hands on the Scratch programming tool. I was fascinated by my ability to bring my own worlds and characters to life using simple programming. Since then, I have remained dedicated to mastering the art of game design. Currently, I am working on developing my own 2D-platformer game using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language.</p>

  <p>In addition to programming and design, I am experienced in digital animation. I completed the online community college course “Fundamentals of 3D Animation”, in which I developed the ability to manipulate and animate digital models. I have also produced and published several 2D computer animations on my YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGNcKt-GpncchY4-xi8t6jw" target="blank">Toon Buffoon</a>. My ability to digitally simulate animated behavior is a vital skill in the field of game design.</p>
  
  <p>My ability as a game designer and as an animator is elevated by my fondness of graphic design. A portfolio of my artwork and comics is available on my website, <a href="https://toonlanding.weebly.com" target="_blank">Toon Landing.</a></p>


  <p>In addition to my projects, my job and volunteering experience has helped me build a strong work ethic. My current role as a tutor at the Russian School of Mathematics has strengthened my fundamental skills, including teaching, speaking, and problem solving. Video game design is a highly collaborative field, so strong social skills and work ethic are vital. </p>

  <p>Overall, my creativity, work experience, social skills, projects and work ethic have all prepared me for the challenging and rewarding career of a video game designer.</p>
