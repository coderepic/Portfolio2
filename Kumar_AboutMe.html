  <p>Hello! My name is Archit Kumar. I am currently a sophomore in Dublin High School, and an aspiring computer scientist. My experience as both a programmer and an artist gives me the unique ability to produce work that is complex and innovative, yet fun and appealing. </p>

  <p>My career in computer science began when I was seven years old, when I first got my hands on the Scratch programming tool. I was fascinated by my ability to bring my own video game worlds and characters to life using simple programming. Since that day, video game design has remained one of my greatest areas of interest. Currently, I am working on developing my own 2D-platformer game using the Unity game engine. </p>

  <p>In addition to video game design, I am experienced in digital animation. I completed the online community college course “Fundamentals of 3D Animation”, in which I developed the ability to manipulate and animate digital models. In addition, I have produced and published several 2D computer animations on my YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGNcKt-GpncchY4-xi8t6jw" target="blank">Toon Buffoon</a>. In the future, I hope to grow my channel and to gain a large following on the YouTube community.</p>

  <p>Another area in which I have combined my artistic and computer-based talents is web design. I created my own website, <a href="https://toonlanding.weebly.com" target="_blank">Toon Landing</a>, in which I publish my digital animations and comics. I hope to build a large portfolio of work on my website and to gain a large base of followers. </p>
  
  <p>In addition to my projects, my job and volunteering experience has helped me build a strong work ethic. My current role as a tutor at the Russian School of Mathematics has strengthened my fundamental skills, including teaching, speaking, and problem solving. I have reinforced these skills through other public activities, including my volunteer service at the Dublin Library.</p>


  <p>Overall, my creativity, work experience, social skills, projects and work ethic have all prepared me for the challenging and rewarding career of a computer scientist.</p>
