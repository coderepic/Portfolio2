      <strong>Volunteer Service</strong>
      </br>
      <p>I volunteer for various groups in order to solve global challenges and to uplift my community.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, I decided to put my game development skills to good use and collaborated with the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a non-profit organization that intends to reduce animal cruelty in society. With the PETA staff, I developed a web browser game to denounce a national health laboratory that performed cruel experiments on live monkeys, urging them to utilize more humane experimentation instead. When the game launches in late September 2020, I hope it delivers a profound message to laboratories around the world.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I serve as a mentor in the Freshman Mentor Program at Dublin High School. This program enables freshman students to have a smooth and enjoyable transition into high school with the assistance of upperclassmen mentors. Bonding with freshmen and equipping them with the resources they need to succeed in high school has been a very rewarding experience. </p>
      <p>I have also contributed to my local library through digital content and supervision for childrens’ activities. I worked to write and publish online reviews for library media including books, movies, and community events. Many of these community events opened my eyes to local issues and gave me a chance to support the community members who had been impacted by them the most.</p>

      <strong>Field Trips and Guest Speakers</strong>
      </br>
      <p>Throughout my involvement with the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School, I have had the opportunity to meet several inspiring industry professionals through field trips and guest presentations.</p>
      <p>One of the most inspiring field trips I attended was a virtual field trip for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. There, I learned about how people with completely different skillsets, ranging from electrical engineering to chemical engineering to computer science, were all able to work together on a variety of projects for the benefit of the nation. The laboratory is developing groundbreaking technology in the fields of nuclear science and energy, and working there to create a sustainable energy source for future generations is somthing I can envision myself doing in the future</p> 
      <p>One memorable speaker I met was Alan Borecky, an engineer who had been involved in the video game industry for more than a decade. Borecky had worked on titles such as the <i>Tiger Woods PGA Tour</i> series, as well as the online multiplayer game <i>Rift</i>. Video game development is a subject that has inspired me for years, and one that most of my technical experience lies in. Learning about how my skills as a game designer could be used to push the boundaries of technology and to create massive social experiences was something that inspired me to continue my projects and experiments in the field.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I had the chance to meet Jason Yosinski, a machine learning scientist and a founder of Uber AI Labs. During his presentation, Yosinski showcased some of his tech experiments, including an artificial intelligence program that could produce its own written articles, as well as a program that could correctly identify the subject of an image through a process of elimination. Yosinski’s work opened my eyes to the efficiency of neural networks and made me wonder about how such technology could be used to streamline aspects of society such as transportation or manufacturing.</p>
