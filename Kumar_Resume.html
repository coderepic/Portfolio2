      <strong>Volunteer Service</strong>
      </br>
      <p>I volunteer for various groups in order to solve global challenges and to uplift my community.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, I decided to put my game development skills to good use and collaborated with the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a non-profit organization that intends to reduce animal cruelty in society. With the PETA staff, I developed a web browser game to denounce a national health laboratory that performed cruel experiments on live monkeys, urging them to utilize more humane experimentation instead. When the game launches in late September 2020, I hope it delivers a profound message to laboratories around the world.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I serve as a mentor in the Freshman Mentor Program at Dublin High School. This program enables freshman students to have a smooth and enjoyable transition into high school with the assistance of upperclassmen mentors. Bonding with freshmen and equipping them with the resources they need to succeed in high school has been a very rewarding experience. </p>
      <p>I have also contributed to my local library through digital content and supervision for childrens’ activities. I worked to write and publish online reviews for library media including books, movies, and community events. Many of these community events opened my eyes to local issues and gave me a chance to support the community members who had been impacted by them the most.</p>

      <strong>Guest Speakers</strong>
      </br>
      <p>Throughout my involvement with the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School, I have had the opportunity to meet several inspiring industry professionals through guest presentations.</p>
      <image src = "./Images/borecky2.png" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%; "/>
      <p>Alan Borecky is an engineer who has been involved in the video game industry for more than a decade. Borecky has worked on titles such as the <i>Tiger Woods PGA Tour</i> series, as well as the online multiplayer game <i>Rift</i>. Video game development is a subject that has inspired me for years, and one that most of my technical experience lies in. Learning about how my skills as a game designer could be used to push the boundaries of technology and to create massive social experiences was something that inspired me to continue my projects and experiments in the field.</p>
      <image src = "./Images/jason.jpeg" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%; "/>
      <p>Jason Yosinski is a machine learning scientist and a founder of Uber AI Labs. During his presentation, Yosinski showcased some of his tech experiments, including an artificial intelligence program that could produce its own written articles, as well as a program that could correctly identify the subject of an image through a process of elimination. Yosinski’s work opened my eyes to the efficiency of artificial intelligence and made me wonder about how such technology could be used to streamline aspects of society such as transportation or manufacturing.</p>
      <image src = "./Images/stewart.jpeg" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%; " />
      <p>John Stewart is the leader of Cisco's security and trust organization, and has many years of experience in cybersecurity leadership. I learned about the high-stakes and often stressful roles that professionals like John have to undertake in order to keep the public safe from cyber criminals. His presentation helped introduce me to more serious applications of computer science, which proved to be far different from the more fun and playful technologies that several of the other guest speakers had been involved in.</p>
      <image src = "./Images/wu.jpeg" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%; "/>
      <p>Lauren Wu is a lawyer at Evidation Health. She discussed her journey toward becoming a lawyer, which was a career she never initially anticipated for herself. She also explained how the role of lawyers in tech and medicine is often overlooked, but is an extremely important step in getting products released to the market. </p>

      <strong>Field Trips</strong>
      </br>
      <p>A crucial aspect of my experience within the Engineering Academy has been the field trips I've had the opportunity to go on.</p>
      <image src = "./Images/llnl.png" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%; "/>
      <p>One of the most important field trips I attended was a virtual field trip for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. There, I learned about how people with completely different skillsets, ranging from electrical engineering to chemical engineering to computer science, were all able to work together on a variety of projects for the benefit of the nation. The laboratory is developing groundbreaking technology in the fields of nuclear science and energy, and working there to create a sustainable energy source for future generations is somthing I can envision myself doing in the future</p> 
      <image src = "./Images/roche.png" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%; "/>
      <p>During my vitual field trip at Roche, I was able to receive advice from healthcare professionals related to college applications and career exploration. The professionals at Roche were involved in technologies such as DNA sequencing, and each member of the team played a different role. For example, while some tema mebers were involved in direct labwork, others developed software that assisted the project. As someone who is interested in software myself, I see healthcare as a potential avenue for my interest. </p>
      <image src = "./Images/salesforce.png" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%; "/>
      <p>During my field trip at Salesforce, I was able to hear from a group of professionals from Salesforce offices all across the world, including from Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. They explained how international collaboration played a huge role in their work, and how their regional roles are able to contribute toward the overall mission of the company. The unique perspectives that each office provided allowed for Salesforce's products to better meet the needs of customers all across the world. I learned the importance of being able to work effectively with people with different backgrounds from yours, and about the joys of international collaboration. </p>
      <image src = "./Images/chevron.png" style = "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%; "/>
      <p>During my field trip at Chevron, I learned about the variety of roles that are played at the organization. I learned that, even though the oil and energy industry has existed since the industrial revolution, the company must still embrace innovation in order to better address environmental sustainability and the changing needs of consumers. I was especially impressed by the roles at the organization pretaining to the applications of computer science for more efficient energy production. As someone who values environmental sustainability, I see work in the energy industryas a possible path for me.  </p>

      <strong>Mentor Program</strong>
      <p>During my junior year, I had the chance to work under the guidance of industry mentors who aided me in planning for college and careers. My mentors, Manish Pandit, was an engineering manager at Meta (formerly Facebook). Some of the most important insights I gained from working with Mr. Pandit were skills related to interviews. Mr. Pandit taught me about the differnet types of questions I need to be prepared for during an interview, the proper structure for answering certain questions, and the importance of small details such as body posture and eye contact. In addition, I learned about the importance of effective project planning and documentation in team settiings. Overall, through the mentor program, I emerged as someone who is far more prepared for the corporate world. </p>
