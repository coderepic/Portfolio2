      <h3>Computer Science Principles </h3>
      <h3>August 14th-September 11th, 2019</h3>
      <p>The goal of this project was to design a fully-playable video game using the "Scratch" programming tool. The video game was required to have increasing difficulty states, as well as responsive user input. My partner and I discussed and brainstormed possible projects, with our inspirations being video games that involved battling large hordes of enemies. We developed a game called “Horde Lorde”, featuring a sea urchin character who must battle increasingly harder waves of enemies in order to defend a sandwich. My partner and I used this project as an opportunity to improve our teamwork and problem-solving skills. We had to work together to decide which mechanics and gameplay features were the best to keep and to further develop. We also collaborated to alter or remove features that felt unfinished or unneeded. We poured tremendous energy into our project, even going out of our way to include a multiplayer mode that was not a part of the project requirements. Overall, this project taught me about the basic fundamentals of variable roles and game design logic. It also taught me the skills necessary to collaborate with a team in a programming-based project, including critical concepts like saving multiple versions of a project. Throughout the duration of this project, my partner and I recorded our progress in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17snYevaSYbU32YoWDGDqtM1PXHf4nG61wPIZAlvIDGI/edit">documentation log</a> that presented our ideas, contribution, and peer feedback.</p>
