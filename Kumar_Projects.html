      <p>The objective of this project was to develop a video game using the Scratch programming tool. My role in this project was to develop graphics and code for the game, while my partner, Jaspal Khanuja, worked to brainstorm ideas and to document the development process. Working on this project taught me about variable roles in programming, as well as how to professionally document the development of a project. A challenge that Jaspal and I encountered during development was when we realized that the player controls we had developed would not enable multiplayer, co-op gameplay -- a feature we had been planning to add. Ultimately, we redesigned the gameâ€™s controls in order to accomodate this feature. Overall, this project helped me strengthen my time-management skills and efficiency in order to create an exciting and finished project within a one-week time limit.</p>

      <p>The goal of this project was to create an enticing image to fulfill the needs of a client. My client was the National Geographic organization, which required a poster that promoted their cause of ocean conservation. I worked on this project individually, and my tasks included choosing a topic, choosing images that could be used to fullfill my client's needs, and writing code that would manipulate my selected images to create a visually-appealing product. Through this project, I learned how to use the image manipulation tools in the Python Imaging Library. Additionally, I strengthened my skills in reading and modifying pre-bluilt code in Python. Throughout the course of the project, the greatest challenge I overcame was deciding a topic for my project. I cycled through many trial concepts before I finally settled on the choice to create a poster for the National Geographic organization. Overall, working on this project individually allowed me to strengthen my personal drive and self-motivation. This experience will help me boost my productivity during any future individual or group programming projects.</p>
